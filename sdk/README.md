# Brevis SDK

High-performance data extraction and loading library for Go.

Extract HTTP data with retry, timeout, and format handling. Load to BigQuery with automatic strategy selection.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk@latest
go mod tidy
```

Requires Go 1.23 or newer (the SDK streams rows as `iter.Seq2`).

> **Do not use `v0.1.0`.** It shipped a `go.mod` pinning a revision that does
> not exist, so it fails to build for everyone. The Go module proxy is
> immutable and cannot be corrected after the fact. Start at `v0.1.1`.

## Three lines

```go
import (
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk"
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/from"
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/to/bigquery"
)

dados, err := sdk.Extract(ctx, sdk.Source{
	From: from.HTTP{
		URL: "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?...",
		Records: func(r sdk.Response) ([]any, error) {
			doc, err := r.Object()
			if err != nil {
				return nil, err
			}
			if bad, _ := doc["error"].(bool); bad {
				return nil, sdk.Reject("open-meteo refused: %v", doc["reason"])
			}
			return sdk.ParallelArrays("hourly", "time", "temperature_2m")(doc)
		},
	},
})

// What we take from the source.
dados = sdk.Transform(dados, sdk.Accept("time", "temperature_2m", "latitude", "longitude"))

// Where it goes, and the columns it has.
res, err := sdk.Load(ctx, dados, sdk.Target{
	To:      bigquery.Table{Dataset: "bronze", Name: "hourly_temperatures"},
	Columns: []string{"time", "temperature_2m", "latitude", "longitude"},
})
```

**The driver is a value, not a setting.** `from.HTTP` carries everything an
HTTP source needs — URL, headers, retry, pagination, and what a response
means. `from.Files` carries a path and a format. Neither has to make room for
the other's fields, so no source struct collects forty options of which any one
driver reads six.

It also decides what you compile. Go prunes dependencies by package imported,
never by field used:

| what you import | packages | AWS | Google |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sdk` | 190 | no | no |
| `sdk` + `from` | 194 | no | no |
| `sdk` + `from` + `to` (files) | 195 | no | no |
| `sdk` + `to/bigquery` | 456 | no | yes |
| `sdk` + `from` + `store/s3` | 265 | yes | no |
| `sdk` + `from` + `store/gcs` | 392 | no | yes |

A whole file pipeline — read and write — costs 195 packages and no cloud SDK
at all. **A driver with a vendor SDK behind it lives in its own package**, which
is why BigQuery is `to/bigquery` and the object stores are `store/s3` and
`store/gcs`.

`Source` and `Target` hold what every driver honours: the preview and counters
on one side, the declared columns, metadata and deduplication on the other.

**The columns come from `Transform` and are declared in `Target.Columns`.**
Whatever shape your transformers compose is exactly what is written; the SDK
adds nothing on its own — the two columns it knows how to write, `ingestion_id`
and `ingestion_loaded_at`, are transformers you put in the chain like any
other.

Everything between the two calls that is not specific to the vendor lives in
the SDK: config, retry, pagination, table creation, deduplication and the
result you log.

## Sources and destinations

| read from | |
|---|---|
| `from.HTTP` | an API: retry, rate limiting, three pagination strategies, and `Records` |
| `from.Files` | files on disk, S3 or GCS: NDJSON, CSV, JSON, XML, `.gz` |

| write to | |
|---|---|
| `bigquery.Table` | a table: GCS staging, `MERGE`, typed creation, partitioning, clustering |
| `to.Files` | files on disk, S3 or GCS: NDJSON or CSV, partitioned, compressed |

### Files, and the three backends

One driver, three backends. The scheme in `Path` says which:

```go
from.Files{Path: "./entrada/*.csv", Format: sdk.FormatCSV}
from.Files{Path: "s3://bucket/dia=2026-09-04/*.ndjson.gz", Store: s3.New(client)}
to.Files{Path: "gs://bucket/landing/", PartitionBy: "ingestion_loaded_at", Store: gcs.New(client)}
```

**The backend is passed in, not chosen inside `Files`** — that is what keeps a
fetcher reading local CSV from compiling the AWS SDK and the Google one. A path
whose scheme the `Store` does not serve is an error naming both, not a
confusing 404.

Files are read in **sorted order, always**. Two runs over the same prefix
produce the same sequence, which a positional `Key` depends on: without it the
`ingestion_id` of a record would change between runs. `.gz` is handled by
extension, and a `.gz` that is not gzip fails naming the file rather than as an
"invalid JSON" three layers down.

Writing is **atomic**: a temporary file and a rename on disk, a single PUT in
object storage. Nobody ever reads half a file. A batch becomes one object, so a
second load does not overwrite the first — a directory has no notion of "the
same rows again", and what to do about duplicates is decided downstream.

`to.Files` refuses what a directory cannot do, naming the option:
`Dedup` has no key to match on, and Parquet would bring Arrow along for a
fetcher that only wanted a file.

## Transform

The step between, where your own function reshapes each record before it is
written:

```go
data, err := sdk.Extract(ctx, source)

data = sdk.Transform(data,
	sdk.Without("generationtime_ms"),                            // request metadata
	sdk.Rename(map[string]string{"temperature_2m": "temp_c"}),   // name it what it is
	sdk.Compute("temp_f", func(r map[string]any) (any, error) {  // derive
		return r["temp_c"].(float64)*9/5 + 32, nil
	}),
	func(payload any) (any, error) {                             // or anything of yours
		r := payload.(map[string]any)
		if r["temp_c"] == nil {
			return nil, sdk.SkipRecord                           // drop the record
		}
		return r, nil
	},
)

res, err := sdk.Load(ctx, data, target)
```

`Transformer` is `func(payload any) (any, error)`. The helpers are the four
things every fetcher ends up writing by hand:

| helper | does |
|---|---|
| `Only(fields...)` | keep just these |
| `Without(fields...)` | keep everything except these |
| `Rename(map)` | source's name → yours |
| `Compute(name, fn)` | add a derived field |

`Rename` and `Compute` refuse to overwrite an existing field: which value
survived would otherwise depend on map iteration order, and a silently
replaced value is the kind of thing nobody notices until the numbers are
wrong.

It stays lazy, so a paginated source still does not have to fit in memory.

**Order matters inside the chain.** `sdk.IngestionID` reads the record after
every Transformer before it, so a rename has to be reflected in the field names
you give it:

```go
sdk.Rename(map[string]string{"time": "observed_at"}),
sdk.Compute("source_key", func(r map[string]any) (any, error) {
	return sdk.Key("latitude", "longitude", "observed_at")(r)
}),
sdk.IngestionID("provider", "entity", "source_key", "observed_at"),
```

Naming the old one is an error listing what the record actually has — not a
short key, which would silently change every `ingestion_id`.

This is a seam, not a transformation engine. Heavy reshaping belongs
downstream in dbt; what belongs here is the shaping a row needs before it is
worth storing at all.

`Driver` selects the implementation on each side — `DriverHTTP` for a Source,
`DriverBigQuery` for a Target. One of each exists today, and an empty Driver
takes the default, so nothing has to be set for the common case.

> **`Driver` is not `Provider`.** Driver is which system carries the rows;
> Provider is which vendor the data came from. Only Provider feeds
> `ingestion_id`.

Or the whole fetcher as a value, which gets flags, `-dry-run`, logging and the
exit code for free:

```go
func main() {
	sdk.Run(sdk.Pipeline{
		Source: sdk.Source{From: from.HTTP{
			URL: "...",
			Records: func(r sdk.Response) ([]any, error) {
				doc, err := r.Object()
				if err != nil {
					return nil, err
				}
				return sdk.ArrayAt("results")(doc)
			},
		}},
		Transform: []sdk.Transformer{
			sdk.Compute("provider", func(map[string]any) (any, error) { return "example", nil }),
			sdk.Compute("entity", func(map[string]any) (any, error) { return "events", nil }),
			sdk.Compute("source_key", func(r map[string]any) (any, error) { return sdk.Key("id")(r) }),
			sdk.IngestionID("provider", "entity", "source_key", "created_at"),
			sdk.IngestionLoadedAt(),
		},
		Target: sdk.Target{To: bigquery.Table{Name: "events"}},
	})
}
```

The first real consumer went from **156 lines to 44** on this API.

`sdk/extract` and `sdk/load` stay available and unchanged: reach for them
directly when you need a shape these two calls do not cover. The hard case has
to stay possible.

### Configuration and where it came from

Resolved in this order: what you set explicitly, then the environment, then the
SDK default, then an error when there is no sensible default.

| variable | default |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` | — (error) |
| `BREVIS_SDK_DATASET` | `landing` |
| `BREVIS_SDK_STAGING_BUCKET` | `<projeto>-brevis-staging` |
| `BREVIS_SDK_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` |

Every run logs where each value came from — `projeto=x (de GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID)`.
Reading the environment silently is how a job works on your machine and writes
to the wrong dataset in the pod.

### Deduplication

`Target.Dedup` defaults to appending, which costs nothing. `sdk.DedupMerge`
stages into a temporary table and MERGEs on `ingestion_id`, so re-running the
same window is a no-op — at the cost of one scan of the destination per load,
which is why it is never enabled on your behalf.

The merge names its columns, reconciling the destination's schema against the
rows before it runs. The rule is asymmetric on purpose:

| situation | what happens |
|---|---|
| the rows carry a column the destination lacks | **refused**, naming the column |
| the destination has a column the rows omit    | fine, it stays NULL |
| the same name with incompatible types         | **refused**, naming both types |

Dropping a column in silence is the worst way to fail — it disappears and
nothing says so — so that case stops the load. A destination column the rows do
not fill is normal, and does not.

### The table

`CreateTable` lets the load job create it on the first run. Off by default, and
it never alters a table that already exists. See **Creating the table** below.

> **`Key` is frozen.** The field order you give it and the `|` separator both
> feed `source_key`, which feeds `ingestion_id`. Change either and the same
> reading lands twice and stops matching the row a Python fetcher writes for it.

## Quick Start

### Extract CSV

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk"
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/extract"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	lines, err := extract.CSV(ctx, sdk.Source{
		URL: "https://example.gov/api/data.csv",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for env, err := range lines {
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("error: %v", err)
			continue
		}
		// Process env
		log.Printf("Payload: %+v", env.Payload)
	}
}
```

### Load to BigQuery

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk"
	"github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/load"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	
	loader, err := load.New(ctx, nil,
		sdk.WithProjectID("my-project"),
		sdk.WithDataset("landing"),
		sdk.WithTable("raw_data"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Prepare envelopes (e.g., from extract)
	envelopes := []sdk.Envelope{
		{
			Provider:  "example_api",
			Entity:    "transactions",
			SourceKey: "tx-123",
			RecordTS:  "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z",
			Payload:   map[string]any{"amount": 100},
		},
	}

	result, err := loader.Load(ctx, envelopes...)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	log.Printf("Loaded %d rows in %v using %s strategy", 
		result.RowsLoaded, result.Duration, result.Strategy)
}
```

## CSV headers

By default the first CSV row is consumed as the column names, so a file with a
header and N data rows yields N Envelopes keyed by those names:

```go
// name,age
// Alice,30
// Bob,25
lines, _ := extract.CSV(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url})
// -> {name: Alice, age: 30}
// -> {name: Bob,   age: 25}
```

Set `NoHeader: true` when the file has no header row. No row is then treated as
special and every line is keyed positionally:

```go
lines, _ := extract.CSV(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url, NoHeader: true})
// -> {field_0: name,  field_1: age}
// -> {field_0: Alice, field_1: 30}
// -> {field_0: Bob,   field_1: 25}
```

## Postgres

```go
import (
    frompg "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/from/postgres"
    topg   "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/to/postgres"
)

sdk.Run(sdk.Pipeline{
    Source: sdk.Source{From: frompg.Query{
        DSN:  os.Getenv("PG_DSN"),
        SQL:  "SELECT * FROM pedidos WHERE atualizado_em > $1 ORDER BY atualizado_em, id LIMIT $2",
        Args: []any{run.LogicalDate, 50_000},
    }},
    Target: sdk.Target{
        To:      topg.Table{DSN: os.Getenv("PG_DSN"), Name: "landing.pedidos"},
        Columns: []string{"ingestion_id", "ingestion_loaded_at", "provider", "valor"},
        Dedup:   sdk.DedupMerge,
    },
})
```

Rows stream: the driver never builds the whole batch before returning. Paginate
by **key**, not `OFFSET` — `OFFSET` is O(n²) on a large table because the server
counts the rows it discards, which is why there is no `Offset` field to reach for.

**Types come from the column, not from the Go value.** Reading, they come from
the declared OID; writing, from `information_schema.data_type`. That distinction
is not academic: pgx hands back `DATE` and `TIMESTAMPTZ` as the same `time.Time`,
so without the OID a date becomes `2026-09-05T00:00:00Z` — an hour nobody wrote,
which shifts a day on the first timezone conversion.

| SQL | JSON | why |
|---|---|---|
| `NUMERIC` | string | `float64` loses cents on large amounts, and the loss surfaces months later |
| `DATE` | `2026-09-05` | no invented hour |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | RFC 3339, UTC | |
| `JSON`/`JSONB` | nested | re-serializing would mean decoding twice |
| `BYTEA` | base64 | |
| `UUID` | string | raw would be an array of 16 numbers |

Writing goes through `COPY FROM STDIN`. **The table must exist**: this driver
does not create it and does not infer types — guessing `NUMERIC(18,2)` from a
JSON number is the one thing this SDK will not do, so the error lists the columns
the batch carries instead, and the DDL comes out of a reading.

`Dedup: DedupMerge` becomes `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (ingestion_id) DO NOTHING`,
which needs a **unique index on `ingestion_id`**. The SDK checks that it exists
and refuses by name if it does not. It never creates one: a loader that can
create an index can lock a production table.

## MySQL

The same shape as Postgres, one line changed:

```go
import (
    frommy "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/from/mysql"
    tomy   "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/to/mysql"
)

From: frommy.Query{DSN: dsn, SQL: "SELECT * FROM pedidos WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id LIMIT ?", Args: args}
To:   tomy.Table{DSN: dsn, Name: "landing.pedidos"}
```

Two differences from Postgres, and both are the database's, not a design choice:

**There is no `COPY`.** `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` usually arrives disabled on both
the server and the client, so the load is a multi-row `INSERT` inside a
transaction. That is why `Table.BatchSize` exists here and does not exist on the
Postgres driver: large packets run into `max_allowed_packet`, and the batch size
is the caller's call. It defaults to 1000.

**Dedup is `INSERT IGNORE`**, which needs the same unique index on
`ingestion_id`, checked the same way and never created.

Types come from `information_schema.data_type`, because `database/sql` hands
back `[]byte` for nearly everything when you read into `any` — without the
declared type every `DECIMAL` would become base64 in the JSON, and so would
every `INT`.

The driver adds `parseTime=true` to the DSN if you leave it out. The result is
the same either way — there is a path for the raw text, and a test proving both
agree — but with it an instant is not re-parsed in Go once per row.

## Redshift

**This driver ships with partial verification, and that belongs here rather
than in a footnote.** There is no Redshift image to run locally, so:

| | |
|---|---|
| tested without a cluster | the generated SQL (`COPY`, `MERGE`, staging table) as pure functions, the S3 staging write, and the order the commands run in |
| **not** tested | that a real cluster accepts that SQL |

Everything else in this SDK is proved against the real server at least once.
This one is not, and the reason is that no such server can be started.

```go
import (
    "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/store/s3"
    "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/to/redshift"
)

To: redshift.Table{
    DSN:     os.Getenv("RS_DSN"),
    Name:    "landing.pedidos",
    Staging: "s3://my-bucket/stage/",
    IAMRole: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/redshift-copy",
    Store:   s3.New(client),
}
```

Row-by-row `INSERT` into Redshift is not viable — it is a columnar store, and
every insert pays for a block. The batch goes to S3 and the cluster `COPY`s it,
which is why `Staging` and `IAMRole` are not optional: there is no inline path.

**`IAMRole` is a role ARN, and an access key is refused.** A key in the `COPY`
statement lands in the cluster's query log, which many people can read.

`Dedup: DedupMerge` runs `CREATE TEMP TABLE … (LIKE destination)`, `COPY` into
it, then `MERGE … WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT` with the column list **named**.
Named always: the BigQuery `INSERT ROW` matches by position, and v0.12.0 shipped
with the columns swapped because nobody had seen the generated SQL.

## Knowing what a load wrote

`to.Files` picks the file name — it carries a timestamp so a second load does
not overwrite the first — and `Result.Objects` is where it says which:

```go
res, _ := sdk.Load(ctx, dados, sdk.Target{To: to.Files{Path: "s3://bucket/landing/"}})
res.Objects[0]   // "s3://bucket/landing/parte-1788639822216855000.ndjson"
```

The path that comes out of a write goes straight back into a read — no
reassembling scheme and bucket:

```go
sdk.Extract(ctx, sdk.Source{From: from.Files{Path: res.Objects[0]}})
```

With `FlushEvery` there is one entry per batch. `Objects` holds only what still
exists after the load, so a destination that stages and deletes leaves it empty —
a reported path that is already gone is worse than none, because somebody will
try to read it.

## Not extracting twice

An extract that spent 4,803 requests and a forty-minute window should not be
repeated because a column at the destination changed type. Two ways to avoid
it, and the first one needs nothing from this library.

### Two nodes, which already works

The engine retries each node on its own. When the extract and the load are two
nodes, a load that fails is retried **without touching the extract** — it is a
different node that already succeeded.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: extract_users
    run: ./fetch-users          # to.Files{Path: "gs://landing/users/${BREVIS_RUN_ID}/"}
  - id: load_users
    run: ./load-users           # from.Files{Path: "gs://landing/users/${BREVIS_RUN_ID}/*.ndjson"}
    retries: 3
edges: [{from: extract_users, to: load_users}]
```

`BREVIS_RUN_ID` is the shared token — the engine injects it into every step —
and `Result.Objects` gives the exact path the write produced. You also get two
boxes on the screen instead of one, and an extract that is visibly a step that
succeeded.

Prefer this when the split is possible.

### One pod: `Checkpoint`

When the fetcher has to stay a single binary:

```go
sdk.Run(sdk.Pipeline{
    Source:     sdk.Source{From: from.HTTP{URL: "https://api.exemplo.com/eventos"}},
    Checkpoint: sdk.Checkpoint{At: "gs://landing/_checkpoint", Store: gcs.New(cli)},
    Target:     sdk.Target{To: to.BigQuery{...}},
})
```

Attempt 0 writes the raw extract under `{At}/{run_id}/{pipeline}/` and marks it
complete. Attempt 1 finds it and **does not call the source at all**:

```
level=INFO msg="checkpoint reaproveitado: a origem nao sera consultada" registros=48213
level=INFO msg=loaded checkpoint=reaproveitado checkpoint_em=gs://landing/_checkpoint/...
```

What it costs: the extract stops being a single streaming pass. The whole
extract lands before the first row is loaded, and is then read back — one extra
write and one extra read of the full volume, on **every** run, to rescue the one
that fails. That is why it ships off.

What it guarantees:

- An incomplete depot is **never** resumed. The manifest is written last; without
  it the extract is redone.
- A depot only serves the run that wrote it, so no stale data enters as fresh.
- The `ingestion_id` of a resumed run is **identical** to the first attempt's —
  it is a UUID v5 of the payload, and the number literals survive the round trip.
- Failing to write the depot does not kill the run: it warns, keeps going, and
  fills `Result.CheckpointError`. The checkpoint is the insurance, not the goods.

`Result.CheckpointReused` says whether the vendor's quota was actually spared.

## Reading from many sources

```go
From: from.Many{
    Sources: fontes,             // one per municipality, per account, per day
    Workers: 8,
    OnError: sdk.ContinueOnError,
},
```

Every ETL that reads from many origins writes the same loop: iterate, tolerate
some failures, record which ones failed, accumulate. This is that loop, written
once.

**`AbortOnError` is the default and stays the default** — it is what the SDK has
always done, and changing it silently would make a run that fails today start
"succeeding" with half the data. What was missing is the choice.

With `ContinueOnError`, a source that fails lands in `Result.FailedSources` and
the read carries on. That mirrors what the load has always done for a bad row —
it reports it in `ErrorRows` and continues — and the asymmetry between the two
sides was the gap. In a fan-out of 4,803 origins, read 3,000 failing used to
take down the 1,803 that had already worked, and the next run redid all 3,000.

**All sources failing is not "zero rows".** Zero rows from N healthy sources is
a result; zero because all N failed is a broken run, and the two must not read
the same in a log — so that case is an error naming the first failure.

**Order.** With `Workers` at 0 or 1 the sources are read in order and the
sequence is deterministic. Above that it is not: records arrive as the origins
answer. That does not affect `ingestion_id`, which comes from the record's
fields and not its position — it affects the preview and anything else that
depends on order. Concurrency is opt-in for that reason.

### Bounded memory

```go
Target: sdk.Target{To: ..., FlushEvery: 50_000},
```

Without it the whole read stays in memory, and the destination builds a second
copy of it to serialize. With it the ceiling is N records plus the copy of N.

What it costs, and it needs saying: **the load stops being atomic.** A failure
on the third batch leaves the first two written, and re-running depends on
`Dedup` not to duplicate. The `Result` sums the batches and comes back even on
failure — hiding that 40,000 rows already landed would be worse than saying it.

## Identity is yours, not the library's

`ingestion_id` is a UUID v5 over `provider|entity|source_key|record_ts`. The
algorithm, the field order and the `|` are frozen: changing any of them rewrites
every id ever written.

**The namespace is not.** The default exists because rows are already written
with it, but a new pipeline should pick its own — one namespace per landing is
what stops two different sources producing the same id by coincidence of key:

```go
var meuNamespace = uuid.MustParse("...")   // once, in the fetcher

Transform: []sdk.Transformer{
    sdk.Namespace(meuNamespace).IngestionID(),
},
```

Changing the namespace of a pipeline that has already written rewrites every id
it has. There is no cheap migration: the next run writes everything again with
new ids, and the bronze merge duplicates the table.

## Snapshotting the record as the source sent it

```go
Source: sdk.Source{From: ..., Snapshot: "payload"}
```

It lives on `Source` and not in the chain on purpose. As a transformer, the
snapshot would depend on its **position**: put it after a `Compute` and the
"raw" record carries the field the chain just wrote. That does not fail — it
produces a wrong row that nobody notices until somebody queries the data months
later. Taken where the record leaves the source, no ordering can contaminate it.

It is a shallow copy: top-level fields are isolated from what the chain does
next, which is where transformers write. A **nested** value stays shared.

`sdk.SkipWithout("id", "atualizado_em")` drops a record whose field is missing
**or null** — a row without the field that composes the key has no stable
identity and cannot go in, but it is also no reason to bring down the whole
window. Note the level: `RequireFields` rejects the whole *response*;
`SkipWithout` drops one *record*.

## Declaring the destination

`Columns` names the destination's columns. `Schema` names them **with a type**,
and it is what a destination needs in order to *create* the table:

```go
Target: sdk.Target{
    To: bigquery.Table{Dataset: "bronze", Name: "pedidos", CreateTable: sdk.Bool(true)},
    Schema: sdk.Schema{
        {Name: "ingestion_id",        Type: sdk.TypeString,    Required: true},
        {Name: "ingestion_loaded_at", Type: sdk.TypeTimestamp, Required: true},
        {Name: "provider",            Type: sdk.TypeString,    Required: true},
        {Name: "temperatura",         Type: sdk.TypeFloat64},
    },
    PartitionBy: "ingestion_loaded_at",
}
```

Setting both `Columns` and `Schema` is an error: two lists of the same thing,
and the one that loses does so silently.

**`CreateTable` needs `Schema` or `CreateSQL`, and refuses without either.**
Until v0.35.0 BigQuery fell back to its own autodetect — the last place in this
SDK where a type came from the data instead of from a declaration. The cost is
not theoretical: the type came from the *first batch*, so a field that arrived
whole today and fractional tomorrow changed the column's type with nobody
writing anything.

The type list is short on purpose. It is not any database's type system: it is
the set a JSON record produces, with one name for each thing. Whoever needs
`NUMERIC(18,2)`, a `REPEATED`, or a type only one destination has writes the DDL
in `CreateSQL`, which exists for exactly that.

**The declaration is checked against the real table before the extract runs.**
The same check ran at load time before; what changed is the moment, and against
a vendor with a quota that is the difference between one metadata query and the
whole window spent to discover a column does not match. Destinations that cannot
check early — a directory of files has no schema, Redshift would need a live
cluster — simply do not, rather than pretending to.

## Porting a fetcher from Python

If a Python fetcher composed its key with `str(record["id"])`, the Go SDK does
**not** produce the same text, and the difference lands in the identity:

| valor | Go (o padrão) | Python (`str`) |
|---|---|---|
| `nil` | `""` | `"None"` |
| `true` | `"true"` | `"True"` |
| `19.0` | `"19"` | `"19.0"` |

The same reading gets a different `ingestion_id` — and that does not surface as
an error. It surfaces as a duplicate row after the bronze merge, weeks later.

**The default stays as it is**, and that is a decision: changing the rendering
would rewrite the `ingestion_id` of every row Go has already written, and the
result is the whole table duplicated on the next merge.

The seam is generic — `KeyWith` and `IngestionIDWith` take any `Renderer`, so a
port from Ruby or Scala uses the same door. `sdk/pycompat` is the one the SDK
ships:

```go
import "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/pycompat"

From: from.HTTP{URL: url, PreserveNumbers: true},

Key:       sdk.KeyWith(pycompat.Texto, "provider", "id"),
Transform: []sdk.Transformer{sdk.IngestionIDWith(pycompat.Texto)},
```

`pycompat.JSONCanonico` is
`json.dumps(v, sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=False)` — the
shape a Python fetcher uses to derive a key when the source has no stable id.
Reproducing it by hand costs about ninety lines and has three traps, each of
which changes the key **without an error**: `encoding/json` escapes `<`, `>` and
`&` and Python escapes none of them; without `PreserveNumbers`, `1` and `1.0`
collapse; and an arbitrary-precision integer loses precision through a `float64`.

It matches **Python**, not a standard. A team starting a new ETL that just wants
a stable key wants RFC 8785 (JCS) instead, and the two must not be the same
function — see the CHANGELOG for why that one is not here yet.

`pycompat.TextoOuVazio` is `str(x or "")`, the idiom most ports use. Note that
`0` and `0.0` become `""` and not `"0"` — that is Python's truthiness, and it is
the case a hand-written version gets wrong.

**It refuses rather than diverges**, and that now includes a bare `float64`.
A `float64` only reaches the renderer once the literal is gone — `encoding/json`
decodes `1` and `1.0` into the same value, and Python saw an `int` in one case
and a `float` in the other. Picking one is right half the time, and the wrong
half is a duplicate row. Turn on `PreserveNumbers`; if the source really was a
float and you cannot, say so with `pycompat.TextoAceitandoFloat64`.

The same applies outside `[1e-4, 1e16)`, where Python's `str()` switches to
exponent notation whose exact shape is a CPython implementation detail.
Imitating it would be a bet placed inside a key.

**`PreserveNumbers` is not optional for integer ids.** `encoding/json` decodes
every number as `float64`, so `{"id": 19}` and `{"id": 19.0}` arrive identical —
and in Python the first was an `int` (`"19"`) and the second a `float`
(`"19.0"`). With it, the literal survives as a `json.Number` and the decision is
the one Python's `json` makes. `Response.JSON` and `Response.Object` honour it
too, so a fetcher that decodes the body itself through `Records` does not have
to remember `UseNumber`.

The cost: a transformer doing `r["x"].(float64)` stops working, because the
value is now a `json.Number`.

## The record belongs to the chain

`Transform` hands each `Transformer` a copy it made for that record, and
nothing outside the chain holds it. **You may modify it in place and return
it** — that is what the built-in transformers do, and it is why a chain of six
costs one map instead of six.

What you must not do is *retain* it: the transformers after yours write into the
same map, and the loader reads it once the chain finishes. If the record has to
outlive your function, copy it.

```go
// fine, and the cheap way
func(payload any) (any, error) {
    r := payload.(map[string]any)
    r["total"] = r["preco"].(float64) * r["qtd"].(float64)
    return r, nil
}

// also fine -- returning a different map is still supported
func(payload any) (any, error) {
    return map[string]any{"resumo": payload}, nil
}
```

This changed in v0.34.0. Before it, every transformer returned a fresh map
"because the caller may still hold it" — true exactly once, for the map the
decoder just produced, which the extract preview keeps so it can show what the
**source** sent. The copy now happens once, in one place, and the other five
were identical work repeated per record.

## What each destination supports

Nine drivers times four options is 36 combinations, and promising 36 without
measuring is how a default reaches documentation that the code does not have.
**The table below is a test** — `capabilities_test.go` checks every row against
the code and fails if a driver accepts an option it does not implement.

| destination | `Dedup` | `CreateTable` |
|---|---|---|
| `bigquery.Table` | `MERGE` | **yes** — BigQuery infers the types |
| `postgres.Table` | `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` | **no such field** — the table must exist |
| `mysql.Table` | `INSERT IGNORE` | **no such field** |
| `redshift.Table` | `MERGE … WHEN NOT MATCHED` | **no such field** |
| `to.Files` | **refused**, naming the field | **no such field** |

Only BigQuery creates tables, because only BigQuery has a service that infers
column types from the data. Guessing `NUMERIC(18,2)` from a JSON number is the
one thing this SDK will not do, so the other three name the columns the batch
carries and let you write the DDL.

Measured throughput, 10k rows of 5 columns against the compose containers —
useful for comparing strategies, not as a production promise:

| destination | strategy | rows/s |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres.Table` | `COPY FROM STDIN` | ~434,000 |
| `mysql.Table` | multi-row `INSERT` | ~137,000 |

The gap is `COPY` versus `INSERT`, not care: MySQL has no reliable `COPY`.

## Pagination

Four strategies, picked by which field you set. Setting two is an error, not a
precedence rule: the loser would be a field you wrote that does nothing. All of
them cap out at `MaxPages` (1000 by default) so a server that always advertises
a next page cannot spin forever.

```go
// Link: <...>; rel="next"
extract.NDJSON(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url, FollowLinks: true})

// {"results": [...], "next_page": "abc"} -- the cursor is sent back as the
// query parameter of the same name, and DataKey says where the rows live.
extract.JSON(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url, CursorKey: "next_page", DataKey: "results"})

// ?page=1, ?page=2, ... until a page comes back empty
extract.JSON(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url, PageKey: "page", DataKey: "results"})

// ?offset=0, ?offset=100, ... until a page comes back empty
extract.NDJSON(ctx, sdk.Source{URL: url, OffsetKey: "offset", PageSize: 100})
```

`MoreKey` is a **stopping criterion**, not a strategy — it combines with any of
the four:

```go
from.HTTP{URL: url, PageKey: "page", DataKey: "results",
          MoreKey: "pageMeta.hasNextPage"}
```

Without it the walk stops on the first empty page, which costs one extra request
**per source** — in a fan-out of hundreds of origins, hundreds of wasted requests
per run. The empty-page stop stays as the safety net: an API that lies in that
field must not become an infinite loop.

A **missing** field is an error, not "no more pages". Treating absence as the end
would stop the walk on page one, silently.

`PageKey` counts pages; `OffsetKey` counts rows, and `PageSize` is how many
rows it skips ahead each time. Before `PageKey` existed the way to paginate by
page number was `OffsetKey: "page"` with `PageSize: 1`, which worked by
accident: the "offset" was counting pages because the step happened to be one.
That still runs — the SDK cannot tell it from a genuine offset of one row — but
it breaks the moment someone touches the page size. Use `PageKey`.

The first request always carries the page number, so the server never picks a
default the SDK would then guess wrong from. `FirstPage` moves the start, and a
number already in the URL wins over it — which is how a zero-indexed API says
so: `…?page=0`.

## Authentication

`Auth` is optional. A static key belongs in `Header` and needs none of this:

```go
from.HTTP{URL: url, Header: http.Header{"Authorization": {"Bearer " + key}}}
```

What `Auth` buys is the two things consumers kept writing by hand.

**A login that is cached**, for an API that rate-limits authentication attempts
rather than requests:

```go
Auth: &from.Credential{
    Value: func(ctx context.Context) (string, error) { return login(ctx) },
    Apply: from.AsBearer,
    TTL:   time.Hour,
}
```

`TTL` keeps the value in memory for the process, behind a lock, so concurrent
callers produce one login and not one each. It never reaches disk.

**A session that would otherwise expire in silence.** Some vendors have no
programmatic login at all: a human pastes a session cookie, it has a sliding
expiry, and only the renewal endpoint pushes the window forward.

```go
Auth: &from.Credential{
    Value: from.FromEnv("APP_SESSION_COOKIE"),
    Apply: from.AsCookie,
    Refresh: &from.Refresh{
        URL:       "https://api.example.com/auth/session",
        ExpiresAt: from.JSONField("expires"),
        WarnAfter: 7 * 24 * time.Hour,
    },
}
```

`Refresh` runs once, before the first page. A `Set-Cookie` in its response
lands in the same jar the pages use, so the renewed credential applies to this
run — and to this run only. **The SDK stores nothing.** A rotated token does
not invalidate the previous one, so the cost is that somebody re-pastes the
credential once per window; `ExpiresAt` and `WarnAfter` are what make sure they
know before it lapses, on the log line *and* in `Stats.CredentialExpiry`.

### Trading secrets for a token

```go
Auth: &from.Credential{
    Login: &from.Login{
        URL:   "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
        Body:  from.JSONBody(map[string]any{"client_id": id, "client_secret": segredo}),
        Token: from.CampoJSON("data.accessToken"),
    },
    Apply: from.AsBearer,
    TTL:   50 * time.Minute,
}
```

`Value` can already do this — it is a `func(ctx) (string, error)`, so a login
fits inside it. What that costs is not obvious: the login request becomes the
**only** request in the fetcher without retry, without rate limiting, without a
per-attempt timeout and without secret redaction in the log. Written by hand it
usually goes out on `http.DefaultClient`, which has no timeout at all.

`Login` makes it with the walk's own client, so it inherits all of that. Pair it
with `TTL`: some APIs rate-limit the *frequency of authentication* rather than of
requests.

The source's `Header` is **not** sent to the login endpoint — it may be another
host, and that header may carry a secret. `Value` and `Login` together are an
error: two sources for the same secret, and the loser loses silently.

### Discovering the sources at run time

```go
From: from.Many{
    Discover: func(ctx context.Context) ([]sdk.Reader, error) {
        // a GET that lists the partitions, and one source per partition
    },
},
```

Built before `sdk.Run`, that list sits outside the pipeline: no retry, no
timeout, no log, and nothing in the `Result` when it fails. Here it runs inside,
and its failure is an extract failure like any other.

A `Discover` that returns **nothing** is an error, not zero rows: a run that read
nothing because there was nothing to read is different from one that did not know
where to read.

### Keeping the rotated credential between runs

Without a store, the renewed value lives for this run only — and somebody
re-pastes the credential once per expiry window, forever.

```go
import "github.com/AreteAcademy/brevis/sdk/store/gcs"

Refresh: &from.Refresh{
    URL:       "https://api.example.com/auth/session",
    ExpiresAt: from.JSONField("expires"),
    Store:     gcs.Credential{Bucket: "myproject-credentials", Object: "app-session"},
}
```

The trade this makes is the point: the environment variable stops holding the
**rotating** value and starts holding the **seed**, pasted once.

The read order is: the store, then `Value` as the seed, then renew, then save.

**Two stores, and `Store` is optional** — without it, nothing changes.

| | where | concurrency |
|---|---|---|
| `gcs.Credential{Bucket, Object}` | an object in GCS | conditional write on the generation read; a concurrent rotation loses the write, not the run |
| `from.FileStore{Dir, Name}` | a file in a directory | last writer wins |

`gcs.Credential` writes with `ifGenerationMatch` on the generation `Load` saw.
If another process rotated in between, the write is refused and **this run keeps
theirs** — that is compare-and-swap, not a lock, and it is why an object beats a
file on a shared mount, where `rename` is not atomic.

`FileStore` resolves its directory from `Dir`, then `BREVIS_CREDENTIAL_DIR`, then
nowhere — and nowhere turns the store **off**, saying so once. The directory can
be `./.brevis`, a compose volume, or a mount: same `Store`, and it is what makes
this work without GCS. File `0600`, directory `0700`, temp file then rename, and
a directory with looser permissions is refused.

**Encryption is optional.** `Key`, then `BREVIS_CREDENTIAL_KEY`; without either,
the value is written in the clear and the log says so once. What protects it is
then whatever guards the store — bucket IAM, directory permissions. A key that
lives in the same secret as whoever can read the store protects against nobody,
and calling that security is worse than not having it. For a **directory**, use
a key: a directory is easier to end up shared than a bucket with IAM.

```bash
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
```

With a key it is AES-256-GCM, a fresh nonce per write. Either way the stored
value carries a version line, and a version this build does not read is treated
as absent — the run falls back to the seed rather than failing, because during a
rollout the same store holds both.

**A refresh that did not authenticate is never saved.** The check is the one the
caller configured: if `ExpiresAt` cannot read the body, the run fails and the
store is left alone. That matters more than it looks — some APIs answer `200`
with an empty body and a `Set-Cookie` that *clears* the session, so what would
land in the store is the credential of a logged-out session. And since the store
is read **before** the seed, saving it would mean swapping the environment
variable no longer fixes anything: the dead value wins every time, and the only
way out is deleting the object by hand.

Without `ExpiresAt` the SDK has no signal at all — the status is `200` either
way — so the value is saved and a warning at assembly says so. That combination
is still poisonable, and the warning is there so the choice is made knowingly.

Failing to save does **not** stop the run — the extract already happened; what
was lost is the rotation. It goes out at `ERROR` and in
`Result.CredentialStoreError`, because the effect is deferred (the next run falls
back to a seed that one day expires) and a deferred effect that only exists in a
log is the one nobody sees in time.

Importing `store/gcs` costs you the Google storage client. A fetcher that uses
`FileStore` never compiles it.

A refresh that fails stops the run. Continuing would send every page out with a
credential the API has just refused, and the failure would come back blaming
the data endpoint.

`Value` errors name the environment variable. `Apply` is `AsBearer`,
`AsCookie` (the whole `name=value`, as copied from a browser),
`AsCookieNamed(name)` or `AsHeader(name)`.

## Cookies

A session cookie survives the whole walk. Hand the first one over in `Header`
and the SDK keeps it in a jar from there, so a `Set-Cookie` that refreshes the
session mid-pagination replaces it by name and page two goes out with the new
value.

```go
sdk.Source{
    URL:    url,
    Header: http.Header{"Cookie": {"session-token=" + os.Getenv("APP_SESSION")}},
}
```

The `Cookie` header is read once and then dropped from the requests, so the
same name is never sent twice with two different values. It is parsed with
`http.ParseCookie`, which splits on the first `=` — a JWT session cookie ends
in `=` padding, and cutting it produces a `401` rather than a parse error.

## Rate limiting

`Source.RateLimiter` is any type with `Wait(ctx) error`, which
`*golang.org/x/time/rate.Limiter` satisfies as-is — so you get it without the
SDK taking on the dependency:

```go
fonte.RateLimiter = rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(time.Second), 1)
```

It is consulted before every attempt, retries included.

## Extract Formats

- **CSV** — tabular data; the first row names the columns (set `NoHeader: true` to key rows positionally instead)
- **NDJSON** — newline-delimited JSON; streaming friendly
- **JSON** — array or single object
- **XML** — the repeated element under the root becomes one Envelope each

## Extract Features

- **Retry with exponential backoff** — 429, 5xx, and network errors only
- **Timeout** — per-attempt and total, separate
- **Records** — you decide what a response means, per response (see below)
- **Pagination** — Link headers, body cursor, or offset (see below)
- **Rate limiting** — any `Wait(ctx) error`, including `*rate.Limiter`
- **Observability** — structured logs with redacted URLs
- **Preview** — print the first records as a table (see below)
- **Stream decoding** — no materializing entire response

### Seeing what you pulled

`Preview` prints the first N records once the extract finishes, the way a
dataframe's `head()` shows the top of a frame. Off by default.

```go
sdk.Source{
	URL:     "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?...",
	Preview: 4,
}
```

```

[4 of 6 rows · 6 columns · 960 B · 3 pages in 262µs · 87µs/page]
```

It answers "what did I actually just pull?" without a debugger and without
draining the stream into a variable to look at it. The sample is taken as the
records stream past, so it costs N records of memory and never changes what
the consumer receives. It still prints when the source dies halfway or you
break out of the loop — which is exactly when you want to see what did arrive.

A pipeline gets it from the command line too, so you can look without
recompiling:

```bash
./my-fetcher -preview 5
```

| field | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Preview` | `0` (off) | how many records to print |
| `PreviewBytes` | `4096` | caps the block; rows are dropped from the bottom and the footer says how many |
| `PreviewWriter` | `os.Stderr` | where the table goes |

The table goes to a writer rather than through `slog` because slog's
`TextHandler` escapes newlines, so a table logged as an attribute arrives as
one unreadable line of `\n`. The counters do go through slog, where a
structured number belongs:

```
INFO extract complete format=json pages=3 rows=6 bytes=960 duration=262µs per_page=87µs
```

`bytes` is what came off the wire, before `Transform` — the number that
explains a slow extract. It is also on `Data.Stats().Bytes` and
`Result.ExtractBytes`.

### Deciding what a response means

`Pipeline.Records` receives every successful response and returns the records
it carries — or refuses it, saying why. It replaces `Guard` and `Expand`, which
were the same question ("what does this response mean?") split in two.

It sits on `Pipeline`, next to `Transform`, and not inside `Source`: `Source` is
configuration — URL, headers, timeouts, retry, pagination — and this is the one
decision in a fetcher that is about the data. On the two-call API it is
`Extract`'s optional second argument.

```go
Records: func(r sdk.Response) ([]any, error) {
	if r.Status == http.StatusNoContent {
		return nil, nil // an empty window is a result, not a failure
	}

	doc, err := r.Object()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	if bad, _ := doc["error"].(bool); bad {
		return nil, sdk.Reject("open-meteo refused: %v", doc["reason"])
	}

	return sdk.ParallelArrays("hourly", "time", "temperature_2m")(doc)
},
```

**Per response, not per record**, and that is the point. A response that is an
error carries zero records, so a per-record check is never called on it — the
failure would arrive as "0 rows", which says nothing about what the vendor
actually answered.

Every **2xx** reaches it, `204` and `206` included, because what those mean is
the vendor's convention and only the fetcher knows it. A non-2xx never does:
that is a transport failure, retried where retrying makes sense and reported
with its body otherwise.

| on `Response` | |
|---|---|
| `Status` | the code, always 2xx |
| `Header` | the response's headers |
| `Bytes()` | the body, undecoded — looking for a marker costs no parse |
| `Object()` | the body as a JSON object, which is what the helpers take |
| `JSON(&v)` | the body into your own type |

`ParallelArrays`, `ArrayAt`, `RejectIf` and `RequireFields` are ordinary
functions you call from in here. They are shortcuts, not the interface: when
the vendor's shape does not fit one, write the function yourself.

Leaving `Records` nil keeps the default — decode the body, one record per
document — and that path stays **streaming**, which matters for a large NDJSON
or CSV. Setting `Records` buffers the response, because a function that decides
what a response means has to see all of it.

### Refusing, and being told apart

```go
return nil, sdk.Reject("open-meteo refused: %v", doc["reason"])
```

A plain `fmt.Errorf` also fails the run, but it cannot be told apart from a nil
map or a typo in the fetcher — and those two want different things from
whoever is on call. A rejection means the vendor sent something that is not
data: the fetcher is fine, the source is not, and retrying the same window will
do the same thing.

```go
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrRejected) { ... }
```

Per record, `sdk.SkipRecord` from a `Transformer` drops that record without
failing the run. See `examples/09-transform`.

## Load Strategy

The loader automatically chooses:

| Rows | Strategy | Benefit |
|------|----------|---------|
| <= 5000 | Inline | One request, no external staging |
| > 5000 | GCS staging | No memory limit, deletes after load |

Both are batch load jobs; they differ only in where BigQuery reads from. The
SDK never uses streaming inserts, so rows are visible to DML as soon as the job
finishes.

Configure the threshold with `sdk.WithThresholdForGCS(n)`, or set
`LoadConfig.ThresholdForGCS` directly. `load.New` accepts either a
`*LoadConfig`, a list of options, or both — and never mutates the config you
pass it.

### What the Result tells you

Every field describes what happened, including `Pages` and `Attempts` — the
two that make a flaky source visible:

```go
res, err := sdk.Load(ctx, data, target)
slog.Info("done", res.Args()...)
// records=24 rows=24 ignored=0 pages=3 attempts=4 ...
```

`Attempts` above `Pages` means requests were retried. There is a test locking
each counter to reality: a number in a result that is always zero is worse
than no number, because nobody doubts it.

For a pipeline that does not load — a dry run, a validation pass, an extract
feeding somewhere else — the same counters are on `Data`:

```go
data, _ := sdk.Extract(ctx, source)
for range data.Records { }
stats := data.Stats()   // read after the stream is drained
```

> The `ingestion_id` namespace is **not** configurable. `WithMetadataNamespace`
> used to accept one and then ignore it — the namespace is a `const`, checked
> byte-for-byte against Python's `uuid.uuid5`. A configurable contract is not a
> contract, so the option is gone rather than wired up.

## What gets written

**The columns you declared.** `Target.Columns` is the destination's shape, in
the order of its DDL, and it names every column — the `Transform` chain
composes all of them:

```go
Target: sdk.Target{
	To: bigquery.Table{
		Dataset: "bronze",
		Name:    "vendors_open_meteo_hourly_temperatures",
	},
	Columns: []string{
		"ingestion_id",
		"ingestion_loaded_at",
		"provider",
		"entity",
		"source_key",
		"payload",
	},
},
```

Put that next to the table's `CREATE TABLE` and the question *"do these
describe the same table?"* is answered by reading, not by tracing.

It is checked three ways:

| | |
|---|---|
| a declared column the `Transform` chain did not deliver | error naming the column |
| a field the row carries that the list does not declare | error naming the field |
| a declared column the real table does not have | error naming the column and the table's own |

The row that reaches the check is exactly what the chain composed, so the check
needs no special case: `ingestion_id` is a column like the others.

Nil declares nothing and checks nothing. There is no fallback: this list is the
only place the destination's columns are declared.

### Accept is not Columns

Two checks, two names, and they catch different things:

```go
Transform: []sdk.Transformer{
	sdk.Accept("time", "temperature_2m", "latitude", "longitude"),  // from the source
},
Target: sdk.Target{Columns: []string{...}},                         // of the table
```

`Accept` asks *"does the source still send what I read?"* — the vendor drops
`temperature_2m` and you get an error naming it, instead of a payload that is
quietly one field short. `Columns` asks *"does the row have the table's
columns?"*. Losing either one to have a single list would trade clarity for a
detection hole.

### As duas colunas que o SDK conhece

`sdk.IngestionID()` e `sdk.IngestionLoadedAt()` são transformers, usados como
qualquer outro:

```go
Transform: []sdk.Transformer{
	sdk.Accept("time", "temperature_2m", "latitude", "longitude"),
	sdk.Compute("provider", ...),
	sdk.Compute("entity", ...),
	sdk.Compute("source_key", func(r map[string]any) (any, error) {
		return sdk.Key("latitude", "longitude", "time")(r)
	}),
	sdk.IngestionID("provider", "entity", "source_key", "time"),
	sdk.IngestionLoadedAt(),
},
Target: sdk.Target{
	To:      bigquery.Table{Dataset: "bronze", Name: "hourly"},
	Columns: []string{"ingestion_id", "ingestion_loaded_at", "provider", "entity", "source_key", "payload"},
},
```

Ler a cadeia dá a resposta inteira: **seis helpers, seis colunas.** Nada
acontece fora dela.

`ingestion_id` é um UUID v5 determinístico sobre
`provider|entity|source_key|record_ts`, então o mesmo registro sempre recebe o
mesmo id e uma reexecução é segura. A fórmula, o namespace e o separador são
**congelados** — uma linha escrita aqui tem de casar com a que um fetcher
Python escreve para o mesmo registro.

É por isso que ele é um transformer do SDK e não algo que você escreve: um
`fmt.Sprintf` no fetcher pareceria idêntico e daria outro id no primeiro float
formatado diferente, e toda carga anterior deixaria de casar.

Sem argumentos lê `provider`, `entity`, `source_key`, `record_ts`. Nomeie os
campos quando os seus diferirem. Campo nomeado e ausente é erro nomeando-o —
o que costuma significar que a cadeia está fora de ordem.

`sdk.IngestionLoadedAt()` escreve o instante da carga em UTC, RFC 3339. Não
recebe argumentos: um valor de fora transformaria "quando esta linha foi
escrita" em outra coisa com o mesmo nome.

### NOT NULL, quando você declara

Quando `Target.Columns` nomeia uma dessas duas, o SDK cria a tabela ele mesmo
para poder declarar aquela coluna `NOT NULL`:

```sql
ingestion_id        STRING    NOT NULL,
ingestion_loaded_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
```

O autodetect as infere nullable e o BigQuery não aperta uma coluna depois, então
a garantia tem de ser posta na criação. **Declare a coluna, tenha a garantia**;
não declare nada e tudo é inferido nullable. O gatilho é a sua própria lista,
então nada decide a forma da tabela pelas suas costas.

`DedupMerge` precisa de `ingestion_id`, e as opções de partição precisam de
`ingestion_loaded_at` — as duas conferidas contra `Columns` quando ele é
declarado.

### A row shape of your own

When the warehouse has a contract, you build it — in one Transformer:

```go
Transform: []sdk.Transformer{
	func(payload any) (any, error) {
		return map[string]any{
			"provider":   "open_meteo",
			"entity":     "hourly_temperature",
			"source_key": payload.(map[string]any)["time"],
			"payload":    payload,
		}, nil
	},
},
Target: sdk.Target{..., Columns: []string{"ingestion_loaded_at", ...}},
```

See [`examples/07-own-shape`](../examples/07-own-shape/).

## Running inside Brevis

A fetcher does not change to run under the engine. The engine injects
`BREVIS_RUN_*` into the step, `sdk.Run` picks it up, and `Pipeline.Run` holds
what is useful:

| what | from |
|---|---|
| `Run.First` | no earlier attempt of this step has succeeded |
| `Run.Params` | the values this execution was dispatched with; never nil |
| `Run.ID`, `Attempt`, `Trigger`, `LogicalDate` | which run this is |

Reading it is optional:

```go
Before: func(ctx context.Context, p *sdk.Pipeline) error {
	if p.Run.Params["load_full"] == "true" {
		p.Source.URL += "&full=1"
	}
	return nil
},
```

Run by hand, every field is zero and nothing behaves differently.

> environment, and someone will. What is promised is that a fetcher does not
> *have* to — not that it cannot. Secrets do not travel this way; they go

## Creating the table

Off by default: nothing runs DDL against your warehouse without being asked.

```go
sdk.Target{
	CreateTable: sdk.Bool(true),   // always, when the table is absent
	ClusterBy:   []string{"provider"},
}
```

Three states, because two are not enough:

| `CreateTable` | outside Brevis | inside Brevis |
|---|---|---|
| `nil` | nothing created | created on the step's first run, or when dispatched with `create_table=true` |
| `sdk.Bool(true)` | created | created |
| `sdk.Bool(false)` | nothing created | **nothing created** — an explicit refusal wins |

A plain `bool` cannot carry this: its zero value would mean both "I do not want
a table" and "I said nothing", and the engine would have no way to tell them
apart. The log says which of the three answered, and why:

```
create_table=true (from the engine: first run of this step)
```

The schema is inferred from the data, because nothing else knows it — the
payload is yours. Two knobs the SDK can still set:

- **Partitioning** by day on `ingestion_loaded_at`, whenever `Metadata`
  gives it that column. Not optional: an unpartitioned landing table costs a
  full scan on every MERGE the bronze layer runs.
- **Clustering**, on the columns you name. The SDK cannot guess them.

With `PartitionExpiration` old partitions are dropped; zero keeps them, which
is the default, because deleting data is not something a library starts doing
on its own. `RequirePartitionFilter` blocks queries that would scan
everything — and is refused alongside `DedupMerge`, because the merge matches
on `ingestion_id` across every partition and cannot be scoped.

To keep the schema under your control, pass the DDL:

```go
sdk.Target{CreateTable: true, CreateSQL: "CREATE TABLE landing.x (...)"}
```

The SDK runs it once, then checks it produced the table being written to. It
never alters a table that already exists, in either mode.

## BigQuery Schema

**You define the schema.** The SDK writes raw JSON payloads.

Create your table with whatever schema makes sense for your data:

```sql
-- Simple: just store the payload
CREATE TABLE {dataset}.{table} (
  payload JSON NOT NULL
)
```

Or with metadata:

```sql
-- Rich: store payload + metadata
CREATE TABLE {dataset}.{table} (
  payload JSON NOT NULL
)
-- With a Metadata block these two sit alongside your own columns:
-- - ingestion_id (deterministic UUID v5)
-- - ingestion_loaded_at (load timestamp)
```

Or structured:

```sql
-- Structured: extract fields from JSON
CREATE TABLE {dataset}.{table} (
  ingestion_id STRING NOT NULL,
  loaded_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  data JSON NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY DATE(loaded_at)
CLUSTER BY ingestion_id
```

## Idempotency

The `ingestion_id` is a deterministic UUID v5 derived from:
- Namespace: fixed (`e3a4f8c0-1b9d-4ea0-9c2e-77f6a6c4a4d7`)
- Key: `{provider}|{entity}|{source_key}|{record_ts}`

**Idempotency is a downstream responsibility** (bronze layer deduplication), not the SDK's. The same envelope loaded twice produces duplicate rows; use `ingestion_id` to deduplicate at bronze.

## Error Handling

Extract errors include URL, attempt number, and duration. Load errors include table name, row count, and per-row BigQuery errors (truncated).

`Load` always returns a `LoadResult`, including on failure, so the per-row
diagnostics BigQuery reported are readable after an error:

```go
result, err := loader.Load(ctx, envelopes...)
if err != nil {
	log.Printf("load failed: %v", err)
	for _, e := range result.ErrorRows { // never nil-derefs
		log.Printf("  %s", e)
	}
}
```

## Configuration

### Extract
```go
fonte := sdk.Source{
	URL:          "https://api.example.com/data",
	Method:       "GET",           // default
	Timeout:      30 * time.Second, // per attempt
	TotalTimeout: 5 * time.Minute,  // total
	NoHeader:     false,            // CSV only; false = first row is the header
	Preview:      5,                // print the first 5 records as a table; 0 is off
	RetryConfig: &sdk.RetryConfig{
		MaxAttempts:    3,
		InitialBackoff: 1 * time.Second,
		MaxBackoff:     60 * time.Second,
		JitterFraction: 0.1,
	},
	Records: func(r sdk.Response) ([]any, error) {
		if !bytes.Contains(r.Bytes(), []byte(`"status":"ok"`)) {
			return nil, sdk.Reject("the API answered %d without status:ok", r.Status)
		}
		var docs []any
		return docs, r.JSON(&docs)
	},
}
```

### Load
```go
cfg := &sdk.LoadConfig{
	ProjectID:       "my-project",
	Dataset:         "landing",
	StagingBucket:   "my-staging-bucket",
	ThresholdForGCS: 5000,
	Format:          "ndjson", // the only format written today; csv and parquet are refused
}
```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./sdk/...
```

Tests for extract use `httptest`; no network access required.

Tests for load use a mock BigQuery client. For integration testing against real BigQuery:

```bash
go test ./sdk/... -short=false
```

The reference test compares `ingestion_id` values against Python implementation to ensure exact idempotency.

## When NOT to use

- **Streaming scenarios** — use Storage Write API for sub-second latency
- **Non-BigQuery destinations** — extend with custom loaders
- **Complex transformations** — use dbt instead
- **Batches > 1GB** — consider splitting into multiple loads

## Performance

- **Binary size** — ~2.4 MB (vs. 144 MB for Python + dependencies)
- **Startup** — < 10ms
- **Throughput** — ~50K rows/sec (limited by BigQuery load job, not SDK)
- **Memory** — O(batch size); stream-based extraction uses minimal memory

## Developing

Build and test locally:

```bash
cd sdk
go build ./...
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

The SDK has its own `go.mod` to keep dependencies minimal. Import only:

- `cloud.google.com/go/bigquery` — official client
- `cloud.google.com/go/storage` — GCS staging
- `github.com/google/uuid` — deterministic IDs
- Stdlib only otherwise
