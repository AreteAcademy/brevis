// reconcile decides which columns the MERGE inserts, and refuses the cases
// where inserting would lose or misplace data.
//
// The destination schema is the authority: it is the one that has to be
// satisfied, and it fixes the order. The values come from the staging table.
//
// The rule is asymmetric on purpose:
//
//   - a column in incoming that the destination lacks is an error naming it.
//     Proceeding would drop that data with no signal, which is the worst way
//     to fail: it disappears and nothing says so.
//   - a column in the destination that incoming lacks is fine. It stays NULL,
//     which a landing table legitimately does -- source_key is nullable and a
//     payload need not fill it.
//   - the same name with incompatible types is an error naming the column and
//     both types. That is today's positional failure, said in the language of
//     whoever has to fix it.
