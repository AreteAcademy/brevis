//
// It is not a field of Source, because Source is configuration -- URL,
// headers, timeouts, retry, pagination -- and this is the one decision in the
// fetcher that is about the data. It lives on Pipeline, next to Transform,
// which is the other thing that runs over what was extracted.
//
// Nil leaves the SDK's default: decode the body and treat each document as one
// record. That path stays streaming, which matters for a large NDJSON or CSV;
// passing a Reading buffers the response, because a function that decides what
// a response means has to see all of it.
